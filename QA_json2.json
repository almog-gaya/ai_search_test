      "question": "What happens if the bank denies the short sale?",
      "answer": "Seller might pursue other options (loan mod, deed in lieu) or face foreclosure. We can re-evaluate if terms change."

    },
    {
      "id": "SSR_033",
      "question": "The seller wants to try a loan modification first.",
      "answer": "Understandable. If it doesn't work out & they pursue short sale, keep us in mind. We'll be here."
    },
    {
      "id": "SSR_034",
      "question": "Is there a minimum offer price you submit for short sales?",
      "answer": "No minimum, but it must be justifiable to the bank based on condition and comps to have a chance."

      "id": "SSR_046",
      "question": "Can you make an offer contingent on short sale approval?",
      "answer": "Yes, all our short sale offers are contingent upon the lender's approval of the short sale terms."

      "question": "The short sale package is missing documents. Can we still submit an offer?",

      "question": "What's the best way to communicate with the bank's negotiator?",
      "answer": "Be persistent, polite, organized. Provide all requested docs promptly. You're the expert here!"
    },
    {
      "id": "SSR_049",
      "question": "The bank's BPO came in really high. What can we do?",
      "answer": "We can provide our own comps or repair estimates to challenge it. Or see if seller can bridge a small gap."

      "id": "SSR_051",
      "question": "What if the seller has government liens (e.g., tax liens)?",
      "answer": "Govt liens can be very tough in short sales. Often need to be paid fully. We'd need to assess that."
    },
    {
      "id": "SSR_052",
      "question": "The seller is considering a deed in lieu of foreclosure. How does that compare to short sale?",
      "answer": "Deed in lieu is giving property back to bank. Short sale is selling to 3rd party. Both avoid foreclosure. Impact varies."
    },
    {
      "id": "SSR_053",
      "question": "How can I, as the agent, speed up the short sale process?",

      "id": "SSR_054",
      "question": "What if the primary lienholder approves but a junior lienholder doesn't?",

      "question": "Seller is asking if they can list the property while short sale is in process.",

      "id": "SSR_058",
      "question": "What if the seller receives a better offer during our short sale negotiation with the bank?",

      "id": "SSR_060",
      "question": "Seller is worried about the 'moral implications' of a short sale.",
      "answer": "It's a business decision to resolve debt. Banks agree to it to mitigate their own losses. Not a moral failing."

    },
    {
      "id": "SSR_068",
      "question": "Seller has two loans from the same bank. Does that simplify the short sale?",
      "answer": "Can simplify, as it's one decision point. But they'll still analyze each loan's position separately."
    },
    {
      "id": "SSR_069",
      "question": "What if the property condition deteriorates during the long short sale process?",
      "answer": "Need to inform bank. Might affect their BPO/valuation. As-is offer means we accept current condition at closing."

      "question": "Are there specific times of year banks are more/less likely to approve short sales?",

      "question": "Can we submit multiple offers from different buyers on the same short sale?",
